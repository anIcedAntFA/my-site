## 1. Crafting Interactive Text: The Layout-Shift-Free Hover

+> Highlighting interactive elements like links on hover is a fundamental UX pattern. However, a naive <mark>`font-weight`</mark> change can trigger ==layout shifts==, negatively impacting ==Core Web Vitals== (specifically Cumulative Layout Shift - CLS). Pseudo-elements offer a refined, CLS-friendly solution.

[==test link==](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/launching-new-front-end/)

**The Core Concept:**

Instead of altering the original text's properties, [dummy link](https://blog.ngockhoi96.dev) we introduce a `::before` pseudo-element containing the same text content. This pseudo-element, styled with the bolder font-weight, is absolutely positioned directly atop the original text. It's initially transparent (`opacity: 0`) and gracefully fades in on hover. The original element's dimensions remain unchanged, thus preventing any layout jank.

**Implementation Insights:**

The provided HTML snippet uses a `data-content` attribute on the anchor tag to hold the text for the pseudo-element. The CSS then uses `content: attr(data-content);` to pull this text into the `::before` element. Absolute positioning ensures precise overlay, while `pointer-events: none;` is crucial to allow clicks and other interactions to pass through to the underlying anchor tag.

**HTML:**

```html
<p>
	This is my personal blog,
	<a
		href="[https://blog.ngockhoi96.dev](https://blog.ngockhoi96.dev)"
		data-content="blog.ngockhoi96.dev"
	>
		blog.ngockhoi96.dev
	</a>
	where I share my thoughts and experiences.
</p>
```

**CSS:**

```css
a {
	position: relative;
	text-decoration: none;
	color: green;
}

a::before {
	content: attr(
		data-content
	); /* Pulls text from the 'data-content' attribute */
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	width: auto; /* Or match parent's width if necessary */
	color: green; /* Or your desired hover color */
	font-weight: 600; /* The heavier font weight for the hover state */
	opacity: 0; /* Hidden by default */
	transition: opacity 0.1s ease-in-out;
	pointer-events: none; /* Allows clicks to pass through to the actual link below */
}

a:hover::before {
	opacity: 1; /* Fade in on hover */
}
```

**Key Technical Takeaways:**

- **Performance:** This technique is excellent for performance as `opacity` transitions are highly optimized by browsers (often GPU-accelerated).

- **Accessibility:** Ensure the `color` provides sufficient contrast in both normal and "hovered" (pseudo-element visible) states.
- **Maintainability:** Using `data-content` keeps the duplicated text within the HTML, which can be good for SEO or if the text is dynamic. For static text, you could also hardcode it in the `content` property, but `attr()` is more flexible.

> Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low altitude service. The connection topology is limited to a single point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers, but many carriers can be used without significant interference with each other, outside early spring. This is because of the 3D ether space available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3. The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance system, which increases availability.

### Enhancing Form Usability: Custom Placeholder Styling

Placeholders play a crucial role in guiding users on what input is expected in form fields. However, default placeholder styles can be bland and inconsistent across browsers. Leveraging CSS pseudo-elements allows for enhanced styling and better user experience.

#### Optimizing Animations: Smooth Transitions with Pseudo-Elements
