## 1. Crafting Interactive Text: The Layout-Shift-Free Hover

+> Highlighting interactive elements like links on hover is a fundamental UX pattern. However, a naive <mark>`font-weight`</mark> change can trigger ==layout shifts==, negatively impacting ==Core Web Vitals== (specifically Cumulative Layout Shift - CLS). Pseudo-elements offer a refined, CLS-friendly solution.

[==test link==](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/launching-new-front-end/)

**The Core Concept:**

Instead of altering the original text's properties, [dummy link](https://blog.ngockhoi96.dev) we introduce a `::before` pseudo-element containing the same text content. This pseudo-element, styled with the bolder font-weight, is absolutely positioned directly atop the original text. It's initially transparent (`opacity: 0`) and gracefully fades in on hover. The original element's dimensions remain unchanged, thus preventing any layout jank.

**Implementation Insights:**

The provided HTML snippet uses a `data-content` attribute on the anchor tag to hold the text for the pseudo-element. The CSS then uses `content: attr(data-content);` to pull this text into the `::before` element. Absolute positioning ensures precise overlay, while `pointer-events: none;` is crucial to allow clicks and other interactions to pass through to the underlying anchor tag.

**HTML:**

```html
<p>
	This is my personal blog,
	<a
		href="[https://blog.ngockhoi96.dev](https://blog.ngockhoi96.dev)"
		data-content="blog.ngockhoi96.dev"
	>
		blog.ngockhoi96.dev
	</a>
	where I share my thoughts and experiences.
</p>
```

**CSS:**

```css
a {
	position: relative;
	text-decoration: none;
	color: green;
}

a::before {
	content: attr(
		data-content
	); /* Pulls text from the 'data-content' attribute */
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	width: auto; /* Or match parent's width if necessary */
	color: green; /* Or your desired hover color */
	font-weight: 600; /* The heavier font weight for the hover state */
	opacity: 0; /* Hidden by default */
	transition: opacity 0.1s ease-in-out;
	pointer-events: none; /* Allows clicks to pass through to the actual link below */
}

a:hover::before {
	opacity: 1; /* Fade in on hover */
}
```

- [x] This is now a clickable, checked checkbox.
- [ ] This is a clickable, unchecked checkbox.

**Key Technical Takeaways:**

- **Performance:** This technique is excellent for performance as `opacity` transitions are highly optimized by browsers (often GPU-accelerated).
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the `color` provides sufficient contrast in both normal and "hovered" (pseudo-element visible) states.
- **Maintainability:** Using `data-content` keeps the duplicated text within the HTML, which can be good for SEO or if the text is dynamic. For static text, you could also hardcode it in the `content` property, but `attr()` is more flexible.
